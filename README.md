# Odin Landing Page

## Introduction

This project is a simple landing page designed as part of the Odin Project. It serves as a demonstration of basic HTML, CSS, and web design principles. The landing page is a static webpage that includes a clean and modern layout, with sections that highlight a service or product. The primary focus of this project was to enhance my skills in HTML and CSS, creating a user-friendly and visually appealing web page.

The main objectives of this project are:

- Building a responsive layout using Flexbox and Grid systems in CSS.
- Structuring web pages with semantic HTML tags for accessibility.
- Styling the page using external CSS to ensure good separation of content and design.
- Creating a functional layout with navigation, content sections, and footer.

This project reflects my understanding of the essential skills needed to create a landing page, and it demonstrates my ability to structure a page that is easy to navigate, visually appealing, and accessible to users.
